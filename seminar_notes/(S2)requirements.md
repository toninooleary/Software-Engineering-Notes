# Requirements

## Functional requirements:
- requirements that make the system function. 
- Requirements needed to be carried out in order to build your system

- often they are requirements that don't need to be  told. e.g. security etc.

## Non-functional requirement
- A desireable requirement!
- Not neccessary but would be nice to implement.

## Why you need these:
- Your functional requirements must come first. They will give you the prerequisite/mandatory features that need to be implemented. 
- This will also provide you with the functionality to show the client.

After functionality is done, then you can make it better with your non-functional requirements. These aren't always essential.

## Domain requirements:
- A requirement of the Domain. 
- A requirement that can improve the product within its sector. e.g. monopoly's domain is gaming. How can we improve it in the gaming sector overall.

## Rating requirements:
- Rate your requiremtns so you know what is mandatory and not.
- This will help with the development process.
