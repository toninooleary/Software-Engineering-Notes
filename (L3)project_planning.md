# Planning a project

## why you need a plan:
* keep trak if your on time
* estimate how long a project will take
* what resources you need
* A well-written plan can help you convince your customer to extend your deadline, or to reduce requirements.

## Flexibility
* Be able to change the plan if something goes wrong in your plan

## An accurate plan needs:
* The scope ( what we will achieve in ieach phase)
* resources (how many people can we have working in parralell etc) - how to use the resources most effectively.
Experience (consider and make use of others' experience) - then use it to drive your timescales

## Software scope:
Start by making a prototype, using its basic functionality
* what are the inputs outputs of the system
* Are there any performance constraints
* How reliability must the system be? (It doesn't matter much if our project crashes as its not an aircraft control system.)

## Resources
* How much equipment is there? what we may use
* What staff can be employed 
* Is any existing software re-usable here

## Experience
* See if anyone has simliar experience of these kinds of projects

## Milestones
* What you will acchieve do by each week.
    * This lets you know if you're on schedule or not.

## PERT(Program Evaluation and Review Technique) charts:
* A visual graphs containing all activitise that need to take place and how they're related to one another
* This lets us see which ones need to come before others. (which come first)

* The tasks are shown by arrows
* task names are letters in this case
* Circles are nodes. Represent start end of a task
* Task duration shown by numbers

## What a pert chart provides us:
* expected project completion time
* Critical path activities that directly impact completion time
* The difference in the latest and earliest finish of each activity is that activity's **slack**
* activities that have slack time can lend resources to critical path activities
* activity start and end dates


blue text shows ealiest start and finish times
red text shows latest start and finish times

Add diagram
note to self:look at working out latest time and document it in an easy to understand format.


## Critical paths
* The path that has the same ealiest and latest start/finish times.
    * They cannot be delayed otherwise they delay the entire project
    * (There's no room for time extensions)
