# Requirements Engineering Pt.1

- The process of establishing the services that a customer wants in their system.
- Requirements themselves are the descriotions of the systems.
    - This includes the constraints that can appear when requirement engineering

## What is a requirement?
- It will descrivbe a useful aspect of what we want to acchieve.
    - The requirements can also be a basis for a legal contract.
    - If you make a game that can only have 4 characters, but the requirements said it should have 6. The customer could say you haven't built what they asked for.

## Requirements abstraction
- The customer should provide what they want. They should abstract their requirements so they don't predefine a solution.
    - e.g. They shouldn't say what languages to use, just what they want.

State **what** you want to acchieve
**NOT HOW** it is to be done.

## Types of requirements

- User Requirements (**User Stories**):
    - Written by the customer

- System Requirements (**Task Cards**)):
    - Development team centered.
    - Should be a detailed description of the system services and operational contraints.

**User requiremnts give rise to system requirements, not hte other way around.

**Example:**

## Functional, non-functional and domain requirements

- Functional:
    -   

- Non-functional:
    - 

- Domain:
    - 

## S.M.A.R.T

A requirement should be:

- **S**pecific
- **M**easurable
- **A**chievable
- **R**ealistic
- **T**imely

## 'Dumb' balance:
**Examples** of bad requirements (for a system to manage medical appointmeants):

A 'dumb' requirement can be:

- A user shall be able to search the appointment lists for all clinics.
- The system shall have a contemporary user interface. 
    - (Contemporary can be an abstract term. It may mean different things for different people)

A good requirement:
- A user shall be able to display all free appointment slots for a specific clinic by selecting the clinic from a system generated list of all clinics in the health provider area and selecting the day, including the current day if required

## Completeness & consistency:

Requirements should be:
- Complete: tell us everything we need to know.
- Consistent: not contradict ourselves

## Non-functional requirements examples:
Can be:
- Reliability
- reponse time (e.g a search system and how long it takes to performa a search.)
